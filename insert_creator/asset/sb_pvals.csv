Avanti,Stafford,STA,,2,"Awaiting discussion with Avanti / GRC, This station is currently under the control of Network Rail (Landlord) but is staffed and managed by Avanti. The station has several platforms but only one entrance and exit for all of these."
Chiltern,Dorridge,DDG,,3,Visited this station with Chiltern.  There were VIX validators in place still.  Three in total.  It was suggested that we replace like for like.  Hopefully we will be able to use the same connections that are there already.
Chiltern,Hatton,HTN,,1,Only one validator is required at this location as agreed with Chiltern reps on site visit
Chiltern,Lapworth,LPW,,2,Two validators are required at this location as agreed with Chiltern reps on site visit
Chiltern,Solihull,SOL,,2,Visited this station and saw that the communications points were still in place from the previous scheme.  We propose to use the same locations which means we only need 2 validators at this location.
Chiltern,Warwick,WRW,,3,Three validators are required at this location as agreed with Chiltern reps on site visit
Chiltern,Warwick Parkway,WRP,,3,Three validators are required at this location as agreed with Chiltern reps on site visit
EMR,Burton-on-Trent,BUT,,1,"Awaiting discussion with EMR / GRC,This station has one island platform that is used by a number of services. There is currently one validator located at the bottom of the staircase leading up to the station exit.  This validator is a VIX model and is used currently for the East Midlands Railway (EMR) smart card scheme. We would need to discuss upgrading to Swift with EMR and VIX"
EMR,Hinckley (Leics),HNK,,2,"Awaiting discussion with EMR / GRC, This station has two platforms and each one has an entrance / exit leading to it. This location currently has no gates or validators.  It would require two validators from the WMT stock. "
